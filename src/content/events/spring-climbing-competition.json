Only the top 5 hardest routes you send count towards your score, so this division is for climbers looking to try as hard as they can. The six highest scoring men/NB & six highest scoring women/NB in the Open Division will get to climb in Finals for a chance to win $500! Prizes will also be awarded to the top 3 in Finals & in the Advanced Division. Review the rulebook below before registering to see if this is the division for you.",

      "description": "If you compete in the Casual Division, your goal is to climb as many routes as possible in the time allotted. Harder problems are worth more points. You'll rack up points for every route that you successfully climb and the 5 hardest routes you send will be worth double points! If you're looking for something a bit different and in a more relaxed environment, the Casual Division might be for you. Review the rulebook below before signing up.",
