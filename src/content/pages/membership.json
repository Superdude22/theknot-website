Then, it's just $80/month, billed on the first of every month.\n\nThere's no contracts, start-up or cancellation fees - so cancel anytime, no strings attached. Cancellation requests will go into effect prior to the next billing cycle. You can enjoy your membership for the remainder of the month, with no worries about it charging you for the next month. All change requests must be submitted at least 5 days prior to billing (usually the 25th of the month), to ensure that we're able to process them in time.\n\nIf you're planning on taking a break, consider our Freeze option instead. Freezing is only $8/month and allows you to easily restart your membership anytime - just pay for the rest of the month & you're good to go!\n\nWe only prorate once, so Cancelled members will have to pay the full membership price when they reactivate their account",
