We follow a 1:1 adult-to-child ratio.\n- For youth ages 13-15, we require at least one adult for every four climbers (4:1 ratio).\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The gym can get crowded during peak hours, which makes it tougher for younger kids to climb safely. For that reason, we recommend that climbers 12 and under plan to finish their sessions before 6 PM on busy evenings.",
